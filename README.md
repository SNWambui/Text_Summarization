## Goal
The goal of this deep learning project is multi-part:
- To get experience in outsourcing and collecting data for data related projects from the web.
- To explore natural language processing as a machine learning technique as we did not cover this in class
- To set up the foundation in learning more about agriculture in Kenya, common topics and conditions for a set of crops in support of my capstone.
- To make use of pretrained models in addition to building new models for language processing.

## Main Sections
1. Web scraping data from agricultural websites
2. Topic modeling to get the main topics in the websites
3. Summarization: abstractive and extractive using both shallow and deep learning models
